                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p class="policy-date">Effective: February 26, 2026</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Thomas Ray Publishing LLC ("we", "us", or "our") built Pomagotchi as a premium application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app. We are committed to protecting your privacy &mdash; Pomagotchi does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. All app data is processed and stored on your device or within your personal Apple ecosystem (iCloud, Game Center).</p>

                <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
                <p>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on our own servers. We do not operate any servers or backend services. Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not collect names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
                    <li>We do not collect browsing history or usage analytics</li>
                    <li>We do not use device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>
                    <li>We do not use any third-party advertising or analytics services</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
                <p>All game data is stored locally on your device using standard iOS storage. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your pet's name, stats, and progress</li>
                    <li>Game high scores and trophy achievements</li>
                    <li>Purchased items and coin balance</li>
                    <li>App preferences (sound, haptics, notifications)</li>
                    <li>Diagnostic logs (event counts and session info)</li>
                    <li>Photos saved within the app's Photo Album</li>
                    <li>Location data used for environment detection (see Location Services below)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is stored only on your device and is not accessible to us or any third party. If you have iCloud enabled, some data may also sync to your personal iCloud account (see iCloud Sync below).</p>

                <h2>Location Services</h2>
                <p>With your permission, Pomagotchi uses your device's location to detect your environment (e.g. home, outdoors, driving) so your pet can react to where you are. Location data is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processed and stored entirely on your device</li>
                    <li>Never transmitted to our servers or any third party</li>
                    <li>Used only to determine general environment context for pet reactions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Location is also sent to Apple's WeatherKit service to display current weather conditions for your pet's environment. This request is handled by Apple and subject to Apple's privacy policy. You can revoke location permission at any time in your device's Settings.</p>

                <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
                <p>If you have iCloud enabled on your device, Pomagotchi automatically syncs your pet's progress, saved poms, and coin balance across your Apple devices using Apple's iCloud Key-Value Storage. This data is encrypted and stored in your personal iCloud account &mdash; it is not accessible to us. You can disable iCloud sync for Pomagotchi in your device's Settings under your Apple Account &gt; iCloud.</p>

                <h2>Microphone Access</h2>
                <p>Pomagotchi offers an optional Sound Reactions feature that uses your device's microphone to let your pet react to nearby sounds. Audio is processed entirely on-device using Apple's built-in sound classification framework. No audio is recorded, stored, or transmitted. You can enable or disable this feature at any time in the app's Settings.</p>

                <h2>Camera, AR &amp; Photos</h2>
                <p>The Teleport (AR) feature uses your device camera to place your pet in augmented reality. Camera data is processed in real-time on your device and is never recorded or transmitted.</p>
                <p>The Photo Booth feature lets you save screenshots of your pet. Photos are stored within the app's private storage on your device. You may optionally export photos to your device's Photo Library (Camera Roll), which requires your permission. No photos are transmitted externally.</p>

                <h2>In-App Purchases &amp; Subscriptions</h2>
                <p>Pomagotchi offers optional in-app purchases and an optional auto-renewable subscription (Pom Club) processed entirely through Apple's App Store. We do not receive, process, or store any payment information. All transactions and subscription billing are handled by Apple subject to their privacy policy.</p>
                <p>The Pom Club subscription provides daily in-app currency rewards. Subscription status is verified on-device using Apple's StoreKit framework. No additional personal data is collected or transmitted for subscription management. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device's Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions.</p>

                <h2>Game Center</h2>
                <p>Pomagotchi integrates with Apple Game Center for leaderboards and achievements. Your game scores and achievement progress are submitted to Game Center and may be visible to other Game Center users depending on your Game Center privacy settings. Your Game Center profile and data are managed by Apple. We do not access your Game Center identity beyond what Apple provides for leaderboard and achievement functionality.</p>

                <h2>Apple Watch</h2>
                <p>If you use the Pomagotchi Apple Watch companion app, pet data is synced between your iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple's WatchConnectivity framework. This communication occurs directly between your paired devices and does not pass through any external servers.</p>

                <h2>Widgets, Live Activities &amp; Siri</h2>
                <p>Pomagotchi supports Home Screen widgets, Live Activities, and Siri Shortcuts to give you quick access to your pet's status. These features use Apple's WidgetKit, ActivityKit, and AppIntents frameworks. Pet data shared with these features stays on your device within Apple's secure app sandbox.</p>

                <h2>Notifications</h2>
                <p>With your permission, Pomagotchi sends local notifications to remind you about your pet's needs. These notifications are generated and scheduled entirely on your device &mdash; no push notification servers are involved.</p>

                <h2>Diagnostics</h2>
                <p>The app maintains a local diagnostics log to help with troubleshooting. This log records event counts and session information on your device only. It is never automatically transmitted. You may choose to manually export and share this data via the Settings menu. The diagnostic report includes your app version, iOS version, and device model but does not include any personal information.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Pomagotchi does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. No personal data is transmitted to us or to third parties. Location data and all other app data are stored only on the user's device and personal iCloud account. The app is safe for users of all ages.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Pomagotchi does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external services used are Apple's own frameworks &mdash; including StoreKit (purchases), Game Center (leaderboards and achievements), ARKit (augmented reality), WeatherKit (weather conditions), WatchConnectivity (Apple Watch sync), iCloud Key-Value Storage (cross-device sync), WidgetKit (widgets), ActivityKit (Live Activities), and AppIntents (Siri Shortcuts). All of these are governed by Apple's privacy policy.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
